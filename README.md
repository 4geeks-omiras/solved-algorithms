# Set of solved algorithms
This is a repository that contains a set of solved algorithms from different sources. This goal has been accomplished with the effort of the members of the [SINGULARS](https://www.pimec.org/ca/institucio/sala-premsa/notes-premsa/pimec-inicia-nous-projectes-dinsercio-laboral-joves) project.
